Dear All Students,

Good morning/afternoon, everyone!

Get ready for an incredible learning journey!

I am Rizowan Ahmed, and I am thrilled to be your teacher this semester. I am committed to guiding, supporting, and inspiring you every step of the way. Together, we will explore the fascinating world of the  Industrial & Ethics, delving deep into both theoretical knowledge and practical insights. Let's unlock our potential, discover new horizons, and make this a semester to remember! My Class will be treated as A Learning Space.  This indicates that our classroom is a shared space, and within it, certain guidelines will help us navigate and make the most of our time together. Mutual respect, active participation, and dedication will be the key elements in creating a dynamic and engaging learning environment.

Throughout our sessions, I am committed to equipping you with crucial insights and practical knowledge that directly apply to the real world. I aim to empower you with a deep understanding of the Labour and Industrial Laws in Bangladesh, going beyond traditional textbook learning.

Your active participation and inquisitive mindset are not just welcomed, but highly encouraged. Feel free to ask questions, engage in discussions, and share your unique perspectives. This collaborative approach will not only enrich your learning experience but also contribute to a more comprehensive academic journey.

I am genuinely excited about our time together and eager to steer you through this intricate domain of law. Let's maximize our classes by fostering an environment of mutual respect, knowledge sharing, and collective growth. I look forward to seeing you in our upcoming classes!

Best regards,

Rizowan Ahmed
